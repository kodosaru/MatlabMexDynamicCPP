Creating C++ Objects Dynamically in a MATLAB MEX File
==============

Illustrates creating C++ objects in pre-allocated memory, and use of these MATLAB functions:
--------------
- mxMalloc to allocate memory for the C++ objects in a MEX file
- mexMakeMemoryPersistent to preserve the memory between MEX calls
- Finally, mexAtExit and mxFree to release the memory when you are finished 



**Copy the files to your local machine and execute "run.sh"**

*Has been tested on Ubuntu 13.10 and 64-bit MATLAB R2013a*

**Happy Coding!**
