Dynamically Create C++ Objects in a MEX File
=====================================================
**Illustrates creating C++ objects in pre-allocated memory, and use of these MATLAB functions:**

* `mxMalloc()` to allocate memory for the C++ objects in a MEX file
* `mexMakeMemoryPersistent()` to preserve the memory between MEX calls
* `mexAtExit()` and mxFree to release the memory when you are finished


**Download the files to your local machine and execute `run.sh`**

*Has been tested on Ubuntu 13.10 and 64-bit MATLAB R2013a*

**Happy Coding!**
